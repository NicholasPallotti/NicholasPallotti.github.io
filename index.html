<p>
    While I was born in Plano Texas, my parents soon decided to move to colorado to enjoy the phenomenal hiking skiing and camping the state has to offer
    (as well as escape the muggy heat of the lone star state). Despite my parents' enthusiasm for the great outdoors I always gravitated towards the indoors,
    enjoying video games, card games like Magic The Gathering and board games. Being born in the nineties meant I had the experience of growing up with much of
    the technology that we use on a daily basis today. Watching i-pods and Razor flip phones develop into i-phones, the internet develop into what it is today, and
    The overall breakneck speed at which technology has evolved drove a fascination with that technology in me, and led to my decision to pursue computer science.
