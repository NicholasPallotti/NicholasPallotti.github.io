    While I was bor in Plano Texas, my parents soon decided to mvoe to colorado to enjoy the phenomal hiking skiing and camping the state has to offer
    (as well as escape the muggy heat of the loen star state). Despite my parents' entusasium for teh grreat outdoors I always gravitated towards the indoors, 
    enjoying video games, card games like Magic The Gathering and board games. Being born in the niineties meant I had the experience of growign up with much of
    the technology that we use on a daily basis today. Watching i-pods and Razer flip phones develop into i-phones, the internet develop into what it is today, and
    the overall breakneck speed at which technology has evelolved drove a fscination with that technolgy in me, and led to my desicion to pursue computer science.
